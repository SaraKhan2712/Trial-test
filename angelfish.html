    <article><p>It is believed that angel fish got their name <strong>because of their shape</strong> - their fins appearing like angel wings and when turned head-down, have a silhouette of an angel.</p>
        <p>Additionally, some of the species have shimmering scales that reflect the light beautifully when observed on a dive</p>
    <p>Does that sound ineteresting to you?</p>

    <h2>Some Interesting facts</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Freshwater Angelfish Are Members of the Cichlid Family</strong></li>
        <p>Angelfish are freshwater members of the cichlid family, and they originate from South America. This group includes other popular fish, such as Oscars, Jack Dempseys, parrotfish, and discus.</p>
        <li><strong>Angelfish Are Omnivores</strong></li>
        <p>What do angelfish eat? Angelfish will eat live foods and plants, so these omnivores need to be fed the right foods to help them reach optimum size and remain healthy.</p>
        <ul type="square">
            <li>It's usually best to offer a daily feeding of flakes or a pelleted diet formulated for angels.</li>
            <li>Supplement the fish with live feedings of freshly hatched brine shrimp, bloodworms, and daphnia grown from your cultures to avoid contaminated sources.</li>
        </ul><br>
        <li><strong>Angelfish Can Grow to Nearly 10 Inches</strong></li>
        <p>On average, well-cared for angelfish will reach about 6 inches at adulthood, which is about a year and a half old. If they're housed in very large tanks and are not overcrowded, they can reach nearly 10 inches, although this would be quite rare in captivity.</p>
        <li><strong>They Are Best Kept With Their Own Kind - they can be aggressive</strong></li>
        <p>These fish are often thought of as community fish, meaning they can live with a variety of other tropical species.</p>
