        <h2>What's our goal?</h2>
        <p>Thinking about starting an aquarium can be an exciting as well as stressful experience as it takes a lot when it comes to fish. They are super-sensitive, different nature - schooling fishes, friendly fishes, aggressive fishes and what not...</p>
        <p>In order to ease your life and reduce the stress, we have tried to put in the basic information about some of the popular species which will help you to decide on how and when to add a new family member</p>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> We need your support to grow. Feel free to provide the feedback/suggestion in the <a href="contactus.html">Contact Us</a> page</p>

                    <p><span class="caps"><strong>Sara Khan</strong> </span>has a passion for pet fishes and that's the reason she has learnt a lot about the different species that are available in the market.</p>
                    <p>It all started with the kids wishing for a pet and she couldn't buy dogs or cats for them which eventually left her with the option to plan for the aquarium. She initially thought that it's going to be an easy task but to her surprise, it needs a lot of research</p> 
                    <p>In order to help the new pet lovers, she has started this initiative so that it could help them plan for their new member without stress. If proper measures are not taken, then it could lead to the fish dying on day1 or day 2 which can be upsetting and discouraging moment for anyone. Right? </p> 
                    <p>Sara's kids were inconsolably crying when they woke up the second day and found that their fish are dead. That was the moment she cannot forget and doesn't want any other kid to be in that situation. Kids should be enjoying this <b>NEW</b> phase of life!</p>

            <h2>What kind of research is needed?</h2>
        <p>Before you can even start the aquarium with live fish, you need to take care of the below items:</p>
        <ul type="disc" >
            <li>How big you need the aquarium?</li>
            <li>How many fishes do you want to keep?</li>
            <li>Are you interested in salt water or fresh water fish?</li>
        </ul>
